# Warehouse Microservices

This project consists of two Warehouse microservices built with FastAPI and a React frontend. It uses Redis as both the database and for streaming communication between the services. The application is deployed on Render for easy scaling and management.

## Features
- Python Microservices architecture for scalability
- FastAPI for high-performance APIs
- React for UI
- Redis for data storage as well as for stream real-time service communication

## Getting Started
To run the project, clone the repository, install dependencies for both backend services and the frontend, set up Redis, and start the services. Each microservice exposes endpoints for product and order management.


## Deployment
The application is deployed on Render, ensuring seamless operation and scalability.
